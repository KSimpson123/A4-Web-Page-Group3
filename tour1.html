          <h2>Northern State Mental Hostpital</h2>
          <p>Northern State Mental Hospital was built near Sedro-Wolley, Washington in 1909. Although known as one of the better institutions of its time, doctors at the asylum performed experimental “treatments” such as lobotomies, electroshock therapy, and forced sterilization. Patients were often heavily medicated without consent during their stays, and it was common for people suffering from misunderstood conditions like depression, post-menopausal syndrome, or alcoholism to be admitted and kept for extended periods of time. Many never left the facility alive.....</p>
		<p><a href="https://www.onlyinyourstate.com/washington/asylum-wa/>Thousands of patients died</a> while in the supposed care of Northern State. Rarely claimed by their families after death, disposal of the bodies was left to the discretion of the state. Some were cremated in an onsite furnace, their remains, (numbering into the hundreds) were stored in tin cans bearing only their identification numbers. According to  hospital records, 1,487 bodies are buried on the grounds of Northern State. </p>
	  <p>Northern State Hospital closed its doors in 1976, but those who <a href="https://spookt.com/place/northern_state_recreation_area_loop_ghost_town">visit</a> the now vacant asylum have reported strange phenomena including “cold spots”, feelings of being watched, and disembodied voices. Strange shadows have been seen darting around the graveyard, as well as sightings of a ghostly man in a wheelchair and a young girl with a red ball. Visit if you dare.....</p>
